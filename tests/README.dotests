The 'dotests' script is a Perl script. Therefore you need to have Perl
installed. In case of failure, make sure that the path to the Perl binary is
correct (which can be found in the first line of the script).

Inside the script are some variables that control the behaviour of the script.

The script is preconfigured to run in the directory in which you build
your compiler binary. The 'tests' directory with all other files needs
to be placed one level above that build directory.

The script expects a return value of the compiler:
  0 for a correct program
  1 for an incorrect program
Other values are considered as a failure. For example, a segmentation fault 
will always result in a non-zero value.
